*The creativity crisis*
</p>

Have you ever thought about the skills that you used to have as a teenager or maybe as a kid, but forgotten now? What was it? Writing? Poetry? Painting? Philosophy? Physics? Dancing? Singing? 

You stumbled upon those interests when you had the joy of discovering, creating, and learning. But what happened afterward? How did all of that get lost somewhere while growing up? How come you can't do those things anymore? How come you can't come up with anything new of your own? How can't you rhyme with the words? How can't you craft a story out of your thoughts? How do you remember the joy of portraying your mind with colors? How have you lost the art of expressing your heart with your body?


Think about it, isn't this an internal crisis… isn't this loss of an identity… isn't the loss of a soul…? What did you create out of that sparkling kid?


Somewhere, while filling up yourself with knowledge and prospects of the external world, you suppressed, or, I’d say, lost touch with the inner you… the real you, and now it’s tough to re-kindle that version of you.

This suppression has accumulated over years and years, and now it has reached a state where there’s very little or almost nothing original left of you.. what you think is cluttered with hundreds of prospectives, what you observe is filtered through many layers of biases… and what you say is again polished from many angles.

Aren't we all the result of a specific set of prospects, standards, and beliefs we agree with? Well, yes... we are... but how will we evolve if we all keep agreeing with everything and start being alike?

The ability to blend many into one... or disperse multiple from one... is creativity, which pushes us… helps us evolve. 

This was much easier when we had the time to think, observe, and express… but slowly, with extreme virtualization, digital noises, and many other factors, we are losing the space we used to have for thinking... blending... dispersing... observing and most importantly 'creating' in the end.

This shrinking space for ‘creating’ is a creativity crisis for everyone.

The space for ‘creating’ is the most crucial part of your persona; with time, you should increase it rather than decrease it. What you create and express out of yourself is how you are perceived by the people around you.

In a world full of artificial faces, voices, and opinions… It is important, rather most important… that you don't lose touch with the original you and shy away from expressing it. Go for it, unapologetically, without seeking any judgment from whosoever.

I can’t give you exact advice on how to re-kindle your creativity by breaking out of your creativity crisis… you will have to find your own way to do it… I just wanted to remind you of the unused treasures within …
