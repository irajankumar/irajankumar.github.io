*The big questions*
</p>
A lot of big questions about life, universe and the way we live is still unanswered.

Why bad things happen to good people ?

Why sensitive and caring people suffer ? Why people who love truly gets cheated and those who cheat get a true love ?

Why hard working people live a miserable life and people not doing anything enjoy life ?

Why people doing good to others get bad things in return ?

I am just a learner, curious about what exactly is life.. Do the definitions we have created about **good and evil**, holds true on life ?

I often wonder how little do we know about **'why we do what we do'**.

We have made classifications. We have made believes about god, good, evil, right, wrong, love, loyalty, cheat, honesty, greatness, success, failure, beauty, ugly and we have huge books full of stories about it too.

But big question is, **do they really hold true on life ?**

What if all the beliefs we have been loving, like 'everything happens for a reason' are wrong ? What if they were just a belief.

There are a lot of beliefs, which still makes us feel good? But is really feeling is being good ?

World is full of people who were great souls but suffered from big pains and people who were evils have enjoyed a huge appreciation.

Everything cannot be composed in stories and questions, but i think we need to discover more about our life, beliefs and how universe works.

It feels like, **Everything whatever we have created... education, religion, divisions, meanings of happy life, meanings of being good are all just inside our heads. Life outside has a different curve.**3:[null,["$","html",null,{"children":[["$","head",null,{"children":["$","$L5",null,{"GA_MEASUREMENT_ID":"G-5KQZJFS1TV"}]}],["$","body",null,{"children":[["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","header",null,{"children":["$","nav",null,{"className":"bg-black
